# pyglet_myteam_game
The goal of this project is to create a small 2D video game "world". The game won't really be playable, but you will create a world that scrolls in the window. To do that, you will use the pyglet library [Phuong Anh](https://pyglet.readthedocs.io). Don't worry, we will do it step by step, together.

We provide you with some examples, but we encourage you to try and do something new, something cool! Be as creative as you want (you can do a Mario-inspired world like us, a pirates world, a post-apo world, a hacker world, etc.). Your creative efforts will be rewarded during the staff review.

All the code for the project must be in the same directory. Feel free to split your code in different files (it's probably a good thing if you do...!). As always, commit your work and push as often as possible. You will probably break some of your code from time to time - and you don't want to have nothing to show during the staff review, right?

There are enough features in this project to split the workload easily between teammates. However don't forget that you are a team: you should help each other out, and you should understand perfectly both your work and your teammates'.

Of course, you don't have to code everything up to the last steps. Go as far as you can, experiment around (it's easy, it's graphic!), and have fun!
